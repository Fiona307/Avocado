This summer, a movie directed by Christopher Nolan, Tenet, was released. Tenet is a action-thriller and spyfi film. The plot follows a secret agent as he manipulates the flow of time to prevent World War III. 

I found "Tenet" a fascinating movie because it gave the audience a platform to seriously consider existential threats, the unconscious mind, and cutting-edge physics. Also, the stunts, the camera work and the scale are impressive.
