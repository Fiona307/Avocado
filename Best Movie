This summer, a action-thriller and spyfi film directed by Christopher Nolan, "Tenet", was released. The plot follows a secret agent as he manipulates the flow of time to prevent World War III. It successfully creates visually stunning action, cool wardrobe and plot that rewinds backwards and forward through time.

I found "Tenet" a fascinating movie because it gave the audience a platform to seriously consider existential threats, the unconscious mind, and cutting-edge physics. Also, the stunts, the camera work and the scale are impressive.
